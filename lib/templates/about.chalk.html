    I am Joel Trottier-Hebert. I develop GWTP applications @ Arcbees during my day job, and code in Dart
    for the rest of my time.

<p>
    I've given some talks about different programming topics, and sometimes I don't have enough time to express my
    thoughts or my points with enough details. The goal of this blog is to share my ideas and to display examples
    I've made in presentations. I may also write about various programming stuff.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to contact me, I always wander on <a href="https://dartlang-slack.herokuapp.com/">Dartlang's slack
    channel</a>. I'm always willing to talk with everyone, don't be shy! I use the nickname Pacane (almost) everywhere online.
