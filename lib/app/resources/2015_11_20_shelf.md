There exists many frameworks and libraries in Dart that can be used to make a REST API, to serve static files or just
to handle Http requests. Many of those use `shelf` under the hood.

The reason why I want to talk about `shelf` is pretty simple: Once you understand `shelf`, you pretty much understand
the base of many other Http oriented framework out there (Redstone.dart, mojito, bridge, etc).

## So what is shelf?

* A web server middleware for Dart
* Very flexible
* Pretty simple
* It makes it easy to create and compose web servers and parts of web servers.
* Exposes a great set of easy to use abstractions

## The vocabulary

### Handler
A `Handler` is a function that receives a `Request` object (which represents an Http request in a `shelf` application), and handles it (duh!). And by "handling" it, I mean it can inspect it, modify it, read its content, etc.

### Middleware
A `Middleware` can provide additional behavior to a `Handler`, by executing code before or after the execution of the extended handler.

### Pipeline
A helper that makes it easy to compose a set of `Middleware`s and a `Handler`. With this, you can wrap a `handler` with multiple levels of `Middleware`s.

### Cascade
A helper that calls several handlers in sequence and returns the first acceptable response.

## Usage
Here are some examples of usages for each of the components previously described. To get started you need to :

* [Create a Dart project](/creating-a-dart-project)
* [Add shelf as a dependency to your project](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/dependencies.html#hosted-packages). At the time of writing this, I used `shelf: "^0.6.4+2"`

### Handler
A handler is expected to return a `Response` object (which represents an Http response in a `shelf` application).

Example:

```dart
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;

void main(List<String> args) {
  Response echoHandler(Request request) =>
      new Response.ok("You've requested ${request.url}");

  io.serve(echoHandler, 'localhost', 8080);
}
```

This piece of code will listen to all incoming requests on `localhost` and return an `OK` response with the URL that was requested as the body.
You can try this by running

### Middleware
A function that accepts a `Handler` as argument. `shelf` exposes a utility function called `createMiddleWare` that helps us creating a `Middleware`.

Here's its signature:

```dart
Middleware createMiddleware({requestHandler(Request request),
    responseHandler(Response response),
    errorHandler(error, StackTrace stackTrace)})
```

It can take:

* A `requestHandler` function. When provided, the `Middleware` process the request.
* A `responseHandler` function. When omitted, the `Middleware` doesn't process the request.
* An `errorHandler` function. 

* The function added before the wrapped handler takes as argument a `Request` object, and can return a `Response` or `null`. If it returns a response, the chain stops there, and the request was handled. If it returns `null`, the request is given to the inner handler.
* The function added after the wrapped handler takes as argument a `Response` object, and can return a `Response` or `null`. If it returns a response, the chain stops there, and the request was handled. If it returns `null`, the request is given to the inner handler.



### Pipeline
An object that accepts multiple `Middleware`s and a handler.

Example:

```dart
var handler = const Pipeline()
    .addMiddleware(loggingMiddleware)
    .addMiddleware(cachingMiddleware)
    .addHandler(application);
```

The last `Middleware` added will be the last to process a request and the first to process a response.
